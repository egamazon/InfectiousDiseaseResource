Infectious diseases (ID) represent a significant proportion of morbidity and mortality across the world. However, the role of host genetic variation in conferring ID risk and downstream clinical complications remains largely unexplored. Here we perform transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) of 35 clinical ID phenotypes, identifying 70 gene-level associations with 26 clinical ID traits. We conduct systematic replication using the independent UK Biobank and FinnGen consortia, demonstrating the value of large-scale electronic health records to prioritize genetic instruments for downstream molecular studies. To delineate the phenotypic consequences of the ID-associated genes, including adverse outcomes, we perform a phenome-scan across hematologic, respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurologic traits, identifying genes associated with disease risk and corresponding (known) complications. Finally, we develop a TWAS catalog of gene-level associations in a broad collection of human tissues with 137 pathogen-exposure induced cellular phenotypes as a discovery and replication platform. Cellular traits include intercellular spread, apoptosis, cytokine production, and pro-angiogenic growth factor host response, among others. We leveraged these data to perform causal inference on the effect of the pathogen-induced cellular traits on the ID clinical traits and adverse outcomes within a Mendelian Randomization framework. Our study comprehensively elucidates the genetic architecture of ID phenotypes and the potential molecular consequences of host genetic variation. These rich datasets will facilitate mechanistic insights into the role of host genetic variation on ID risk and pathophysiology, with important implications for our molecular understanding of potentially severe phenotypic outcomes.
